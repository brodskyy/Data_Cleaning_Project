## CodeBook

This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

### Source Data
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Data Set Information

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.

* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.

More information about the files is available in `README.txt`. More information about the features is available in `features_info.txt`.

### Data files that were not used

This analysis was performed using only the files above, and did not use the raw signal data. Therefore, the data files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were ignored.

### Transformation details

There are 5 parts:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### How ```run_analysis.R``` implements the above steps:

* Require ```reshapre2``` and ```data.table``` librareis.
* Load both test and train data
* Load the features and activity labels.
* Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data.
* Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively.
* Merge data set.
